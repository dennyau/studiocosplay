            <h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>
The idea for Studio Cosplay originated from our own need for more workspace and specialized equipment, and we recognize that many in the cosplay community face the same challenges.  The average cosplayer may not have access to embroidery machines and 3D printers. But as a community, we can acquire and share these resources.
</p>
<p>
We founded Studio Cosplay because our creations should only be limited by imagination; not by logistics or lack of knowledge. Meet the people dedicated to bringing you Studio Cosplay:
